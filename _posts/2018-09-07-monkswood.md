I woke just in time to witness our Uber cross the threshold of the archway that sat at the end of Monkswood’s sprawling driveway. As I peered through the back window, I nudged my wife, who had also fallen asleep during the three hour drive through the countryside and wooded lands of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. “We’re here,” I whispered. Diane glanced at the gateway, which was now receding in the distance. As the car pulled forward, we were once again surrounded by an endless wall of trees, most of them overgrown pines.

Diane put a reassuring hand on mine. “Are you sure you’re ready for this?” She asked.

I shrugged then motioned towards the endless line of trees. “Too late to turn back now,” I said.

I pulled a loosely bounded zine out of my bag. On the front of it was a title “What the Mad Men Wrote,” sprawled in large, wavy letters. Inside was a collection of stories written by the patients of Monkswood. Entry number five was written by my Uncle Robbie, and had centered around a distant memory he had with my father, who was his twin brother. We were on our way to Monkswood now to inform him that his brother had recently passed away. And, to ask him some questions about what he had written.

Finally, the Uber slowed to a stop in front of the institution’s main building. On the front, right above the huge double doors made out of oak was the name “Monkswood Asylum.” As soon as I laid eyes on the building, I felt safe to assume It was one of the least cheeriest places will ever visit.

“That will be one hundred and twenty five dollars,” The Uber driver said. “Did you want me to wait for you?”

“No,” my wife said as she handed him her credit card. “That’s alright.”

“Sure.” He waited for us to get our gear and then climb out of the car, but then started the car and pulled it back around without another word, as if running from some unseen evil.

I slipped the strap of my bag around my shoulder, and then lead my wife up the steps and into the main lobby of the psychiatric hospital. Inside, a receptionist was seated at a very plain desk.

“May I help you?” She asked.

“My name is Carl Weathers, and this is Diane,” I said, motioning to her. “We are here to see Robert Weathers.”

“I see,” she answered, scanning what appeared to be an appointment book. “Ah, I see that you have a consultation scheduled with his doctor, Dr. Downer.”

Diane stifled a giggle. “Doctor . . .Downer?”

I gave her a quick jab to the stomach. The receptionist ignored the comment. “Feel free to have a seat in the waiting room. I’ll let him know that you’re here.” She reached under the desk, and pressed a hidden buzzer.

The waiting room was a smaller room just off of the lobby.

“So, what are you going to tell him?” Diane asked.

“I’m not sure. Maybe that my dad has passed away. I’m not even sure if Robbie will remember him.”

“He must, though,” Diane said. “He wrote that entire story about what happen to him and your father when they were boys. Maybe your father is the only person who he still remembers.”

“Maybe, I--”

Just then, the door to the waiting room opened, and a slender man in his mid fifties peeked into the room. He was tall, and wore a beige colored lab coat. “Mr. and Mrs. Weathers?” He asked.

“Yes,”I responded.

“Excellent to meet you, I’m doctor Downer.” We exchanged handshakes. “Follow me to my office.”

Dr. Downer’s office was filled with many bookshelves filled with psychology books and trophies. His wall was lined with awards, certificates, and many photos of him standing next to patients, or groups of nurses.

“Robert Weather has made excellent progress, especially over the last few years,” Dr. Downer began as we sat down. “I assume that you received the zine?”

I pulled my copy out of my bag. “Er, yes.”

“The publication was an experiment of ours, to see how well free writing would help with our patients’ rehabilitation. I would say that it was successful, for the most part,” Downer explained. “Your uncle turned out to be an excellent writer. Very vivid.”

“Yes, that’s why we wanted to see him,” my wife said. “If his story is true--”

“All of the stories submitted for the zine are true,” Downer interjected. “We encouraged our patients to draw from their past experiences. Your uncle’s memories may be tarnished with age, or his telling of the events may feel difficult to swallow, but they are true.”

“How did you come to choose writing as a form of therapy,” I asked.

“It was actually one of the methodologies recommended by the original founder of Monkshood, Doctor Ebenezer Monkshood. At the time, many of his theories were rejected by the community. But, he pressed forward and produced amazing results. I decided to replicate parts of his study.”

Downer stood up abruptly. “It is time for you to see your uncle. He’s waiting for you in the cafeteria. Come, I’ll take you there.”

We exited his office, then continued down the same long hallway which we had followed from the waiting room. After walking for a few feet, we arrived at an elevator which looked like it hadn’t been updated since the 1960’s. Downer pulled the door aside, and then gestured for us to enter.

Inside, he pressed a button which both put the elevator car into motion and triggered what sounded most like an airhorn. “Our patients come here with a wide variety of conditions. Many are curable,” Downer said.

“Can my uncle be cured?” I asked, unable to hide the doubt I felt from my voice. He had been here for nearly fifteen years.

“For your uncle, he can only hope to be better than he once was,” Downer responded. I felt a sudden jolt as the elevator car came to a complete stop. “Perhaps that is why he focused on a memory from his childhood, a time before he developed his condition.”

Downer led us along a hallway which took us by a number of patients’ rooms. Some of the residents were passing through the hall. Threw the corner of my eye, I noticed that my wife was clutching her purse a little more tightly.

“Most of our patients are harmless,” Downer said, “so there is no need for concern. Our more challenging patients live on the lower floors, where we have tighter security.”

Downer opened the doors to the cafeteria, and guided us towards the only soul inside: my uncle, Robbie. He was seated at a table, quietly spooning chocolate pudding out of a bowl and into his mouth. He wore a drab white button up shirt and matching white trousers. I settled into a chair which sat directly across from him. My wife chose to stand. Without a word, Downer turned and exited the cafeteria through a door marked “kitchen.”

“Robbie,” I said. “Do you remember me?”

“Carl? Carl. Of course I do, buddy,” Robbie said, his eyes scanning me. When he said “buddy,” his lips momentarily parted into a bright smile.

“And this is my wife, Diane,” I said.

“Diane...Diane...good to meet you. I didn’t even know that you were married.”

“We celebrated our tenth year last Spring,” I offered.

“Oh, okay, okay. Pudding?” He had offered out a plastic spoon piled high with a glob of chocolate pudding.

“No, that’s okay,” I said. “Listen, I wanted to tell you something.” I took a big breath. “Your brother, Nicholas, passed away--”

“I know, I know,” Robert interrupted. “I knew when it happened. Two weeks ago. On a Tuesday. Nine fifteen.”

“That’s...correct,” I said, feeling emotion swelling inside as the memories from my father’s last moments flooded back.

“Cancer.”

“Yes. How did you know?”

“A twin knows.”

I looked at my wife, then looked back at Robbie. He was sort of staring off into space, one hand still holding out the spoon. “He told me he was passing,” Robbie said suddenly, as though just speaking his thoughts out loud. “He said he was sorry.”

“Sorry..for what?” I said.

“He told me everything that happened, before he died,” Robbie said. “Then I wrote it down, and gave it to Dr. Downer.”

“Do you mean that story you wrote in the zine came from...Did my father tell you that story?”

“Blanks. Filled in the blanks.”

I peered down at the publication, which was now torn and worn from the number of times I had re-read it. As disturbing as it was, some part of me found it reassuring to be able to learn about an aspect of my dad’s life that had never been told to me before. If Robbie had been somehow told this story, then perhaps there was some purpose to it.
